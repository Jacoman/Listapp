Listzilla is an android application with persistent data allowing users to add Recipes to their homepage with a list of ingredients attached to it. 


Future plans: To allow users to utilize their saved recipes by adding them to a shopping list, once added to a shopping list, the ingredients will be automatically added to it.
Thus, saving users time by not having to consistently retype the same things on a grocery list each shopping trip.
